# CRUD-APP-
### So the idea of the app is to make  a platform that people can talk about nouns with each other. 
### so i have the api that i will pull words from. maybe there is one that has just nouns but for now i have one that is and if i get to that point than i can make something that just allows nouns to be talked about. Like a forum. It doesn' let me search for people though so just places and things but that's fine. so you hit the log in page and you will have to sign in before you start to do stuff because that's the way that things work nowa days. but maybe just on the home page it will display the most liked word and all it's comments i guess. so after they log in they can call the api that will make the query to the api and display that words stats from the api (like definition, and usage and some other things) than that get's posted to that users page to the left or right side. Than then there is a link that will hold all of the most searched for words. or maybe there will be some way to add words from other peoples pages to your own.

- What is your project proposal? 
	-make an app that allows users to share movies or words. I don't know which one 
- List your MVP criteria?
	-have a sign in page that lists all the most popular items and a form to either sign in or sign up 
	-have a users page that shows all the user's items along with a blurp about that user if they want to share?
- Any plan for your models / data relationships?
	-Basic user Schema with it's items in an array login and what not 
	-items schema will have data. I was thinking about using an api but we will see 
    - Can all users see the index for all of your resource or only access their resource?
    	the index will just render the most popuar items and allow them to sign in 
    - Is your resource mutually exclusive to a user?
      	users can see their items and then go to the items index and see all the items click on that item and go to that items show page and there will be info of the item and the comments left by users about that item 

- What aspects of your approach/attitude can you enhance having experienced and learned from project 1?
	i totally screwed up with my first project so i am hoping to do a lot better with this one. With my first 	
		project i totally screwed up everything so i will have a much better game plan with this project i hope

- What are your next steps for today (End of Day Objectives) as well the weekend in order to accomplish your MVP? by the end of today i would like to have all my routes laid out and my login and log out button working if possible
