#Features
A simple site that allows you to check out the pages and comment on of varies antagonist's from varies movies and books.

#How it works
It's a very simple 5 page node project. Each villain has their own show page that are all basically the same. None of the routes are too complex.

I would love to add some more styling to it and have it look nice in all formats. I would also like a voting system where everyone can vote for their favorie Villain!
