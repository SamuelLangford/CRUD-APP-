#Features
A simple site that allows you to check out the pages and comment on of varies antagonist's from varies movies and books.

#How it works
It's a very simple 5 page node project. Each villain has thier own show page that are all basiically the same. None of the routes are too complex. The users don't really have anything to do with what the site does. 

##Future implications 
I would love to add some more styling to it and have it look nice in all formats. I would also like a voting function where everyone can vote for their favorie Villain!.
