# CRUD-APP-
### So the idea of the app is to make  a platform that people can talk about nouns with each other. 
### so i have the api that i will pull words from. maybe there is one that has just nouns but for now i have one that is and if i get to that point than i can make something that just allows nouns to be talked about. Like a forum. It doesn' let me search for people though so just places and things but that's fine. so you hit the log in page and you will have to sign in before you start to do stuff because that's the way that things work nowa days. but maybe just on the home page it will display the most liked word and all it's comments i guess. so after they log in they can call the api that will make the query to the api and display that words stats from the api (like definition, and usage and some other things) than that get's posted to that users page to the left or right side. Than then there is a link that will hold all of the most searched for words. or maybe there will be some way to add words from other peoples pages to your own.
